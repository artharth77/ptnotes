# Changelog 0.2.0

## [0.2.0] — 2026-08-06

### Fixed

- Chat now displays an error message when the AI server cannot be reached. Previously the first message in a session could fail silently: the `error` stream event could arrive after `chatStreamProject` had already been reset to `null`, so the renderer dropped it. The handler now falls back to the active project so the error is always applied to the last assistant message. See [#1](https://github.com/artharth77/ptnotes/issues/1).
